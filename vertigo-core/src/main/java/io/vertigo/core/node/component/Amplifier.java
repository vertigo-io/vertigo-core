/**
 * An amplifier is a special core-component.
 * It's defined by a simple API (aka a java interface).
 * The "real" component is automatically from annotations that explain 
 * how to deal with their decalarations
 * 
 * Technically, the created core-component is a java proxy.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * The perfect use case of the amplifier is when you have to request a remote server, 
 * that's to say when you need a simple client. (sql, webServices, redis...)
 * 
 * The amplifier tanslates the particular request (defined in a anotation) in a java code.
