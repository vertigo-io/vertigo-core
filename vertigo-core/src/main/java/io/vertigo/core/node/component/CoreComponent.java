/**
 * A core-component is one of tbe key concept of vertigo.
 * 
 * A core-component 
 * - is thread safe
 * - has parameters 
 * - a state
 * - offers services (technical or business)
 * 
 * There is 4 types of core-component
 *  - Component
 *  - Plugin 
 *  - Connector 
 *  - Amplifier 
 *  
 * Each core-component 
 *  - can be Activeable
 *  - can have aspects
 *  - can have parameters
 *  
 *  
 *              +----------+----------+--------+------------------------
 *              |    API   |  IMPL    | Scope  | ...can be injected 
 *  +-----------+----------+----------+--------+------------------------
 *  | Component | optional | required | node    | in all core-components
 *  +-----------+----------+----------+--------+------------------------
 *  | Amplifier | required | no       | node    | in all core-components
 *  +-----------+----------+----------+---------------------------------
 *  | Plugin    | required | required | module | only in components
 *  +-----------+----------+----------+--------+------------------------
 *  | Connector | no       | required | node    | in all core-components 
 *  +-----------+----------+----------+---------------------------------
 *  
 *  Each core-component must be defined in a specific module.
 *  A plugin is a kind of private component (with a module scope),  
 *  it's used to abstract the way to bridge a specific java library.
 *  So, plugins concentrate all the dependencies. 
 *  This facilitates the evolutions when a version of a library is updated. 
 *  
 *  notes : 
 *  A "manager" is a special marker used to identify technical components created in vertigo.
 *  Each module can define its own type of component. 
 *  For example "webServices" may be the root of all webServices..
 *  This approach is very usefull to define a semantic structure of all the components.
